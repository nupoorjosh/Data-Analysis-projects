### Credit card data analysis

1. Credit Card Defaults have become much common than before these days. Credit card defaults occur when one becomes severely neglectful about credit card payments.
2. Defaults can not only harm credit card ratings within a bank but can impact their overall credit
   scores.
3. To address the issue of potential default, prediction of credit card defaults is essential. The
   predictive analysis can help prevent financial losses to the credit card companies. It can also help
   in being proactive by providing financial advice to customers that are more likely to default.
